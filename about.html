            <section id="about-section">
                
                <p>Hey there! I’m William Mweemba, a tech enthusiast, problem solver, and lifelong learner who’s always eager to 
                    explore new technologies. <br>With over a decade of experience across the service, banking, and financial sectors, 
                    I’ve had the opportunity to work on transformative IT <br>projects, from core banking migrations to mobile banking 
                    rollouts. Throughout my career, I’ve worn many hats—system administrator,<br> infrastructure manager, network 
                    specialist—all of which have strengthened my ability to bridge the gap between business needs and technical<br> 
                    solutions.</p>
                <p>But if we’re being honest—I always wanted to be a developer. Now, as part of the PLP Feb 2025 Cohort, I’m making
                     that dream a reality!<br> I love experimenting with new tools, hacks, and practices to see what works 
                     (and what doesn’t), and I’m especially fascinated by AI and<br> how it can be applied to solve real-world problems.
                      My approach to technology is hands-on—I believe the best way to understand something<br> is to test, break, and 
                      refine it until you unlock its full potential.</p>
                <p>I thrive in dynamic environments where innovation and creativity fuel problem-solving. Whether it’s optimizing 
                    business processes, <br>implementing security best practices, or building intuitive user experiences, I’m always up 
                    for a challenge. When I’m not deep-diving into the latest<br> tech trends, you’ll probably find me tinkering with 
                    new ideas, refining my skills, or helping businesses leverage technology for growth.</p>
                <p>Lets connect and build somthing great!</p>
