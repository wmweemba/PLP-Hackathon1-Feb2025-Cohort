                                <h3>Rock Paper Scissors Game (HTML)</h3>
                                <p>This was a fun and foundational project where I built a simple Rock Paper Scissors game using plain 
                                    HTML and JavaScript. It may look simple, but it taught me a lot about DOM manipulation, basic 
                                    logic handling, and creating interactive web elements. It's a great example of how small projects 
                                    can sharpen fundamental web development skills.</p>

                            <h3>Savings Group Loan Calculator Plugin (PHP / WordPress)</h3>
                            <p>Built specifically for savings groups and microfinance users, this custom WordPress plugin 
                                calculates loan interest, repayment schedules, and other key metrics. It’s designed to be 
                                user-friendly and easy to integrate into existing WordPress websites. This project combined my 
                                interest in financial services and technology, and reflects my ability to create tailored 
                                solutions for niche problems.</p>

                            <h3>Client Websites (WordPress)</h3>
                            <p>Over the years, I’ve developed several websites for clients using WordPress. Each site was 
                                tailored to the client’s brand and business needs, from local startups to small service-based 
                                businesses. I handled everything from layout and plugin setup to optimization and basic SEO, 
                                ensuring the sites not only looked good but also performed well. This ongoing work keeps me sharp 
                                in real-world web design, UX principles, and client communication. Here I showcase my most recent
                                client website</p>

                            <p>This personal blog was where I documented my experiences, tips, and discoveries in the world of 
                                network engineering. Built with a clean layout and minimalist design, the blog focused on 
                                practical tutorials and real-world troubleshooting scenarios. It served both as a knowledge-sharing
                                 platform and a way to track my own learning progress over time.</p>

                            <p>I co-founded and helped build a tech startup focused on offering ICT solutions—ranging from 
                                infrastructure setup and IT support to custom web solutions. I played a hands-on role in 
                                developing digital tools, managing the technical side of client engagements, and helping small 
                                businesses integrate effective tech into their operations. This venture not only deepened my 
                                entrepreneurial skills but also gave me insight into scaling tech in real-world business settings.</p>
